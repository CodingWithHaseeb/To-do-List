📝 To-Do List App  

This project is a simple yet powerful **To-Do List web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It provides an easy way to organize tasks, manage daily activities, and keep track of things you need to complete.  
The application features a clean and user-friendly interface, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users who want a lightweight task manager.  

The app allows users to **add tasks**, **edit existing tasks**, and **remove tasks** when they are completed.  
All tasks are stored in the browser’s **localStorage**, which means that the list remains intact even after refreshing or closing the page.  
This makes it a practical tool for anyone looking to quickly manage personal to-dos without installing additional software.
